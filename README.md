## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://benji250.github.io/project-browser-game/.


## Project Description

This game is a jumping game where the boy jumps over a lot of saws. One thing that inspired me to make this game was the dinosaur game and how simple it looks but I soon found out how hard it is to make for a beginner.  


## Game Logic

```
One of the choice that the player has is how far they want or can go this game might be a little difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, it gets easier.
One way to lose this game is if you fail to get 50 points before you die.




### MVP Criteria

XXX IMPORTANT! Replace the text below as you list the MVP criteria you met AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX
One thing my game has to do to meet minimum standard is be able to play and not have so many issues and also have a score and  highscore working, one last thing that I want in my game is animations. 



### Post-MVP Plans

XXX IMPORTANT! Replace the text below as you list what you would do to improve the game post-MVP AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)


XXX IMPORTANT! USE THIS SPACE FOR THE SCHEDULE WE END UP MAKING IN CLASS AND ADD ANY PERSONAL INFO AS NEEDED.
